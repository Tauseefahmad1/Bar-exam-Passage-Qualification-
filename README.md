# Bar-exam-Passage-Qualification-
Predict whether or not a student will qualify the bar exams or not
You are working with an NGO named Transparent Affiliates which seeks to foster research on the use of preferences in higher education. It also seeks to foster transparency. In pursuit of both goals, the Project seeks to secure relevant data from universities and research organizations, and to make that data available to a broad community of users. In July 2007, it began an effort to secure admissions data from all of the public law schools in the United States.They obtained from the Law School Admissions Council (LSAC) some twenty-seven thousand law students through law school, graduation, and sittings for bar exams. The result was the most comprehensive database that exists on the demography, experiences, and outcomes of a large cohort of aspiring lawyers. 

 

(1) How much weight is given to numerical credentials in law school admissions? 

(2) How narrow is the band from which students are admitted? 

(3) What do the acceptance and rejection patterns of law applicants tell us about the degree to which "rankings" dominate other factors in law school choice?

 

Your Task is to make use of Machine Learning models to Predict whether or not a student will pass the bar, based on the features provided.
